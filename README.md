# AwareSample
Sample app for Awarness API that was showcased at: https://www.meetup.com/AndroidListener-Chicago/events/233339910/


## Note
API keys will work only on debug builds from my computer, so if you want to play around with this app, go to https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials and create project/credentials for the API and update it in manifest XML.
